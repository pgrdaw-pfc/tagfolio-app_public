-- Flyway Undo Script for V010301
-- Flyway Undo Script for V010301.
-- This script does nothing, as the forward migration was a non-destructive data copy.
-- The data in the original columns is left intact until migration V010302 is run.
-- A rollback of V010302 is responsible for restoring the schema and data.

-- This script is intentionally left empty.
